# Complex Nonlinearities

This repository contains recent research exploring purely digital complex nonlinear signal processing.
Articles explaining the project in further detail can be found on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jatinchowdhury18/complex-nonlinearities-episode-0-why-4ad9b3eed60f).

Current nonlinearities include:

1. [Double Soft Clipper](https://medium.com/@jatinchowdhury18/complex-nonlinearities-episode-1-double-soft-clipper-5ce826fa82d6))
