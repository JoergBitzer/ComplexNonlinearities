# Complex Nonlinearities

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/ComplexNonlinearities.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/ComplexNonlinearities)

This repository contains recent research exploring purely digital complex nonlinear signal processing.
Articles explaining the project in further detail can be found on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jatinchowdhury18/complex-nonlinearities-episode-0-why-4ad9b3eed60f).

Current nonlinearities include:

## Organization

Each subfolder contains a specific nonlinearity, including Python simulations
and a real-time implementation in JUCE/C++.
