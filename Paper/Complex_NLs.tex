\begin{abstract}
In this writing, we present an ongoing study of new and interesting
nonlinear structures for audio signal processing, intended to be
used for audio effects and synthesis. We give a brief discussion of
each structure, and present a series of open-source audio plugins that
implement the structures.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
%
In digital audio signal processing it is common to find audio effects
that use nonlinear elements to add harmonic content to the signal being
processed, or to achieve a ``distortion'' type of effect. Typically, this
is done either as part of an analog model, or using a static memoryless
nonlinear element.
\newline\newline
%
The goal of this research project is to develop structures for nonlinear
audio signal processing that go beyond the traditionally used simple
nonlinearities. While the structures developed here may be used for
analog modelling and may be inspired by analog effects, they do not
come about from direct physical modelling of an analog system, nor
do they require knowledge of analog systems such as circuits to be
understood and implemented.

\subsection{Simple Nonlinearities} \label{sec:simple}
%
We refer to the desired nonlinear structures as ``Complex
Nonlinearities'', as such we should take a moment to define what
constitutes a ``simple'' nonlinearity, particularly since these will
make up the building blocks of the complex nonlinearities that follow.

\subsubsection{Saturators} \label{sec:sat}
%
The most commonly used nonlinearity in audio signal processing is
the saturating nonlinearity, where the input ``clips'' to a constant
value as the input gain increases. This class of nonlinearity includes
functions such as the hard clipper, cubic soft clipper, and $tanh$
nonlinearities \cite{Yeh}, which are described by the following functions:
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{hard clip}}(x) = \begin{cases}
        -1& x < -1 \\
        x& -1 \leq x \leq 1 \\
        1& x > 1
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:hard-clip}
\end{equation}
\newline
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{soft clip}}(x) = \begin{cases}
        -\frac{2}{3}& x < -1 \\
        x - \frac{x^3}{3}& -1 \leq x \leq 1 \\
        \frac{2}{3}& x > 1
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:soft-clip}
\end{equation}
\newline
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{tanh}}(x) = \tanh(x)
    \label{eq:tanh-clip}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{../NonlinearBiquad/Pics/Sat-NLs.png}
    \caption{\label{Sats}{\it Saturating Nonlinearities}}
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection{Rectifiers} \label{sec:rect}
%
Sometimes for audio effects such as compressors and limiters, it is
useful to have a rectified signal (i.e. a signal that only contains
non-negative values). The two most simple rectifying nonlinearities
are the full-wave rectifier and the half-wave rectifier:
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{FWR}}(x) = |x|
    \label{eq:fwr}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{HWR}}(x) = \begin{cases}
        0& x < 0 \\
        x& x \geq 0
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:hwr}
\end{equation}
%
The above rectifier equations have a downside in that they don't have
continuous derivatives. As a substitute we present an alternate
half-wave rectifier equation loosely modelled from a Shockley diode
rectifier:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{Diode}}(x) = \beta \left(e^{\alpha x} - 1 \right)
    \label{eq:diode}
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are tunable parameters.
%

    \includegraphics[width=3in]{../Exciter/Pics/rect_static.png}
    \caption{\label{Rects}{\it Rectifying Nonlinearities. For the diode nonlinearity,
    we use $\beta = 0.2$, $\alpha = 1.93$.}}
\end{figure}
%

    \center
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{Pics/dropout.png}
    \caption{\label{Drops}{\it Dropout nonlinearity with $a = 0.6$.}}
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection{Dropout} \label{sec:drop}
%
Another nonlinearity used in audio effects is the ``dropout'' nonlinearity,
notably used for modelling underbiased analog tape recording \cite{DAFX-tape}.
A dropout nonlinearity is characterized by the fact that small input values
are snapped to zero. Here we present a simple cubic dropout function:
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{Dropout}}(x) = \begin{cases}
        x + B - \left(\frac{B}{a}\right)^3& x < -B \\
        \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^3& -B \leq x \leq B \\
        x - B + \left(\frac{B}{a}\right)^3& x > B
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:dropout}
\end{equation}
%
where $a$ is a tunable parameter, and $B = \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{3}}$.
%

\section{Double Soft Clipper} \label{sec:DSC}
%
The Double Soft Clipper (see \cref{DSC}) is a sort of
combination between a saturating nonlinearity and dropout
nonlinearity. The nonlinear function is given as:
%
\begin{equation}
    f_{\text{DSC}}(x) = \begin{cases}
        1 & u \geq 1 \\
        (3/4) * (u - u^3/3) + 0.5 & 0 < u < 1 \\
        (3/4) * (u - u^3/3) - 0.5 & -1 < u < 0 \\
        -1 & u \leq -1
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:double-soft-clip}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
    u(x) = \begin{cases}
    x - 0.5 & x > 0 \\
    x + 0.5 & x < 0
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:double-soft-clip_u}
\end{equation}
%
The resulting static curve is essentially two cubic soft
clipping functions stacked on top of each other (see \cref{DSC-stack}).
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{../DoubleSoftClipper/Pics/Double.png}
    \caption{\label{DSC}{\it Double soft clipper.}}

%

    \center
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{../DoubleSoftClipper/Pics/stacked.png}
    \caption{\label{DSC-stack}{\it Stacked soft clippers.}}
\end{figure}
%
One advantage of this nonlinear function is that it is highly
parameterizable. Possible parameters include upper/lower clipping
limit, linear slope, upper/lower skew,  and dropout width (see
\cref{DSCs}).

\section{Harmonic Exciter} \label{sec:exciter}
%
A harmonic exciter is an audio effect often used by mixing
engineers to add ``brightness'' to a track or a mix, for example
the Aphex Aural Exciter \cite{aphex}. Typically, digital exciter effects
are implemented as circuit models of an original analog effect (e.g.
\cite{exciter-model}). The goal of this work is to create a
generalized exciter model that can be implemented without knowledge of
circuit theory, much in the way that \cite{giannoulis2012digital} describes
a generalized model of a dynamic range compressor.
\newline\newline
Based loosly on the Aphex Aural Exciter, we propose the
exciter architecture shown in \cref{exc}. For the generator
component, we propose the processing architecture shown in
\cref{gen}.
\newline\newline
For the level detector component, we propose using a rectifying
nonlinearity followed by a lowpass filter. \Cref{detect} shows the
output of a level detector with the rectifying nonlinearities described
in \S\ref{sec:rect} and a first-order lowpass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 10 Hz. For the nonlinearity component, any saturating
nonlinearity of the type described in \S\ref{sec:sat} will suffice. The
output of the generator is very harmonically rich, with both even and odd
harmonics, as seen in \cref{exc-harm}.

\section{Hysteresis} \label{sec:hysteresis}
%
Hysteresis is an interesting complex nonlinear behavior
that describes the magnetising of magnetic materials, as
well as concepts in other fields including chemistry, structural engineering,
even economics. \cite{DAFX-tape} uses an adaptation of the Jiles-Atherton
magnetic hysteresis model to recreate the sound of an analog tape machine.
In this study, we attempt to generalize this hysteresis model to be used
and implemented without understanding of electromagnetic physics,
as well as adding useful parameters to the hysteresis nonlinearity.
\newline\newline
%
The hysteresis model for input $x$ is defined by the differential equation:
%
\begin{equation}
    \dot{y} = \frac{\frac{(1-c)\delta_y(SL(Q) - y)}{(1-c)\delta_xk - \alpha(SL(Q) - y)}\dot{x} + c \frac{S}{a} \dot{x} L'(Q)}{1 - c\alpha \frac{S}{a} L'(Q)}
    \label{eq:hysteresis}
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot{y}$ denotes the time derivative of the output, and $k$ and
$a$ are constant values. $\delta_x$ and $\delta_y$ are defined as
%
\begin{equation}
    \delta_x = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $x$ is increasing} \\ -1 & \text{if $x$ is decreasing} \end{cases}
    \label{eq:delta-x}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
    \delta_y = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $\delta_x$ and $L(Q) - y$ have the same sign} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
    \label{eq:delta-y}
\end{equation}
%
$L(x)$ denotes the Langevin function:
%
\begin{equation}
    L(x) = \coth(x) - \frac{1}{x}
    \label{eq:langevin}
\end{equation}
%
and $Q$ is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
    Q(x,y) = \frac{x + \alpha y}{a}
    \label{eq:hyst-q}
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha$ is a constant value, and $x$ and $y$ are the system input
and output respectively.
\newline\newline
The variables $S$, $a$, and $c$ from \cref{eq:hysteresis} can be used
as parameters to control the hysteresis function saturation, drive,
and width respectively. \Cref{hysteresis} shows the effects of modulating
these parameters.

\section{Nonlinear Biquads} \label{sec:nlbq}
%
Transposed Direct Form II (TDF-II) (see \cref{tdf2}) is a standard method for
implementing biquad filters in signal processing. We present two
methods for adding nonlinear elements to the TDF-II structure that
can create interesting sonic effects without affecting the filter's
stability.
\newline\newline
For the first method we propose adding nonlinear elements before the delay
elements in the filter structure, as shown in \cref{nlbq}. When saturating
nonlinearities are used for these elements, the filter exhibits ``nonlinear
resonance'' similar to many analog filters. The filter frequency response at
various operating points is shown in \cref{nlbq-lpf}.
\newline\newline
For the second method we propose adding nonlinear elements to the feedback
paths of the filter, as shown in \cref{nlfd}. Again, with saturating
nonliearities, this structure causes the filter poles to ``sweep'' to
different frequencies as the input level of the filter varies. The filter
frequency response at various operating points is shown in \cref{nlfd-lpf}.
\newline\newline
In order to maintain stability, we propose that the nonlinear elements must
satisfy the constraint that $|f'_{NL}(x)| \leq 1$ (note that this implies that
the derivative of the nonlinear function must exist everywhere in the range
of $x$). A proof of this constraint using Lyapunov stability, as well as a
more in-depth analysis of these nonlinear filter structures, including the
potential use of these structures for analog modelling, is given in
\cite{NLBiquad}.

\section{Wavefolding} \label{sec:wavefold}
%
Wavefolding is a sonically interesting nonlinear effect, where
as the input level of the waveform increases, the wave seems to
``fold over'' on itself. This effect is especially popular in
certain analog synthesizers. Circuit models of wavefolding effects
have previously been developed in \cite{DAFX-wavefold,appl_sci-wavefold}.
In this work we attempt to create a purely digital wavefolder, with
some intruiging extensions on the traditional wavefolding effect.
\newline\newline
We begin with a well-known oversimplified wavefolding nonlinearity:
$f_{NL}(x) = \sin(x)$ (other waveforms could replace the $\sin$ wave
used in this formula, e.g. a triangle wave). The output of a sine
and triangle wavefolder are shown in \cref{simple_fold}.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{../Wavefolder/Pics/simple_fold.png}
    \caption{\label{simple_fold}{\it The output of simple sine and triangle wavefolders.}}
\end{figure}
%
\subsubsection{Saturating Wavefolder}
%
We can make a simple modification to the simple wavefolder, by summing
its output with the output of a saturating nonlinearity, with the gain
of the wavefolder output smaller than the gain of the saturator output.
This architecture (including a variable gain $G$ after the wavefolder) is
shown in \cref{sat_wave}; the static curve of the saturating wavefolder
nonlinearity with $G=-0.2$ is shown in \cref{sat_static}. Finally, in
\cref{sat_wave_large} we show the response of the simple sine wavefolder
and the saturating wavefolder for a very large input signal. Note that
while the simple wavefolder allows the signal to flip all the way from
positive to negative within a half cycle of the dry signal, while the
saturating wavefolder does not. In this way, the saturating wavefolder
exhibits behavior more similar to traditional analog wavefolders, and
is sonically less ``harsh''.
%

    \caption{\label{sat_wave_large}{\it Comparison of wavefolder outputs for large input.}}
\end{figure}
%
\subsubsection{Saturating Feedback Wavefolder}
%
We can modify our wavefolder architecture further, by adding a
feedback path with another saturating nonlinearity, as shown in
\cref{fb_wave}. The resulting nonlinear function has an interesting
textural characteristic, almost a sonic ``squishiness'' caused by the
feeding back of the already folded wave. This behavior is hinted at by
the dynamic curve of saturating feedback wavefolder (see \cref{fb_dyn}),
but for a better understanding, we recommend listening to the audio
examples presented in \S\ref{sec:pres}.

\section{Subharmonics Generator} \label{sec:subharm}
%
From a frequency-domain perspective, most of the nonlinear processors
discussed thus far serve to create higher frequency content than that
of the input signal, often a useful aspect of many distortion and exciter
effects. In this section, we look at developing a nonlinear system for
generating lower frequency content, or subharmonics. Most existing
methods for generating subharmonics often rely on spectral domain
processing (e.g. \cite{sub_spectral}), which can be difficult to use
as a real-time effect, or rely on isolation of the fundamental frequency
for which to generate the subharmonic as in \cite{sub_sqrt}. Here we
strive to develop a simpler, yet more general technique that can run in
real-time, and be useful on  variety of input signals (i.e. even when
we are not able to isolate the fundamental).
\newline\newline
First, we develop a simple switching detector, that can detect when the
input signal switches directions. If we have our switch detector output
a $1$ when the signal is increasing, and a $-1$ when the signal is
decreasing, we can generate a square wave of the same frequency as the
input, as shown in \cref{square_full}. Next we can adjust our generator to
only flip the signal every {\it other} time a switch is detected in the
incoming signal, thereby generating a square wave with half the frequency
of the original signal (see \cref{square_half}). Finally, we can use a
lowpass filter to smooth our output signal into something more like a
sine wave (see \cref{sine_half}). To verify our subharmonic generator
we show the frequency spectra of the input and output signals in
\cref{freq_compare}.
\newline\newline
To make our subharmonic generator more usable as an audio effect, we can
attach a level detector and an input lowpass filter as shown in
\cref{sub_arch}. The level detector ensures that the generator output
follows a similar amplitude envelope to the input signal, although in
practice adjusting the attack and release of the level detector (similar
to a dynamic range compressor) can create an interesting effect where the
subharmonic outlasts the original signal, adding a ``boomy'' quality to
the overall sound. The input lowpass filter is meant to limit any high
frequency noise that might cause the switching detector to generate
signal above the desired subharmonic frequency. In practice,
this effect can be used to add low frequency content to signals
including drum sets, bass guitars, keyboards/synthesizers, and more.

The field of machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has benefitted
greatly from the clever use of nonlinear functions including the hyperbolic
tangent, sigmoid, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and more. In recent years,
a unit known as the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) has become popular for
use in recurrent neural networks \cite{gru_original}. In this section
we examine the use of a simplified form of the GRU, known as a ``minimal
gated unit'', as a parameterizable distortion effect.
\newline\newline
The operation of the minimal gated unit, as introduced in
\cite{minimal-gated-unit}, can be described by the following equations:
%
\begin{align}
    f[n] = &\sigma (W_f x[n] + U_f y[n-1] + b_f) \\
    y[n] = &f[n] y[n-1] + \\
    &(1 - f[n]) \tanh (W_h x[n] + U_h f[n] y[n-1] + b_h)
    \label{eq:minimal-gated-unit}
\end{align}
%
where $x$ is the input, $y$ is the output, and $W_h,W_f,U_h,U_h,b_h,b_f$
are all free parameters. $\sigma(x)$ denotes the sigmoid function:
%
\begin{equation}
    \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
    \label{eq:sigmoid}
\end{equation}
%
Typically, when used in a recurrent neural network, the elements of the
above equations are vectors and matrices, and several of the multiplications
are instead Hadamard products, however given the use of the minimal gated
unit presented here, we can assume all elements to be scalars, and all
products to be scalar products. We will also choose $b_h=0$ to avoid
adding unwanted DC noise to our signal. The final architecture of the
minimal gated unit presented here is shown in \cref{gru-arch}.
\newline\newline
Adjusting the parameters of the gated recurrent unit can lead to a versatile
set of dynamic nonlinear behaviors. The dynamic response of the effect
when varying each parameter individually is shown in \cref{gru-params}.
Note the great variety of distortion curves that are possible using a
gated recurrent architecture, from simple saturation to hysteresis-like
behavior. The harmonic response of the gated recurrent distortion can be
equally versatile, with an adjustable mix of odd and even harmonics.
One example harmonic response is shown in \cref{gru-harm}.

\section{Implementation and Presentation} \label{sec:pres}
%
The work done in this study was designed to be informative and inspiring
both to recording engineers and musicians, as well as programmers and
aspiring DSP engineers looking to design audio effects. With this audience
in mind, it was determined that the results of this work should be written
and presented for a relatively non-technical reader, and published in a
location where these readers would most easily find it. To that end, the
results of this work have been published as a series of articles on the
popular blog website Medium \footnote{\url{https://medium.com/@jatinchowdhury18}}.
According to statistics on the site, the articles have been read approximately
400 times as of this writing. Additionally, the structures developed
in this study have been implemented as a series of audio plugins using JUCE/C++.
The plugins and their source code are freely available on GitHub
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/ComplexNonlinearities}}.
Finally, video and audio demos of the plugins are published on YouTube, to
demonstrate the sonic characteristics and practical usefulness of the
effects created in this study
\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrcXtWXbPsj1SS-3zfcaiRpuETqMYy6Hw}}.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
%
In this paper, we have presented a series of complex nonlinear signal
processing structures, with the intention of being used for audio effects
and synthesis software. While this work has developed a number of useful
and sonically rich structures, there is great potential for many more
developements in this area of audio signal processing. We look forward
to seeing more audio effects being built using these methods, as well as to
more nonlinear DSP methods being developed in the vein of this work.
